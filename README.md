# Pseudocode

Pseudocode is a live programming environment for pseudocode implemented by [Keshav Saharia](http://keshav.is). It started as a project for my advanced students and high school interns to develop a programming language, and has evolved into a useful teaching tool that we use at [TechLab Education](https://techlab.education). All of the code is open-source and well documented, so it should be quite easy to [add new instructions](#add-new-instructions), modify the [parser](#modify-the-parser), and [test your work](#writing-tests).

The next step after pseudocode is a conventional program like Python or Java. I'm also the developer of [Pythonroom](https://pythonroom.com), a fun and easy way to teach Python in any classroom.
