# Pseudocode

Pseudocode is a live programming environment for writing natural language programs implemented by [Keshav Saharia](http://keshav.is) and maintained by the instructors/interns at [TechLab Education](https://techlab.education). 
It is designed to be a fun introduction to typed programming languages, without the burden of syntactical correctness or error messages. 

**Keshav will add GIF here**

There is no "run" button and no error messages - code is executed as you type it, and instructions that cannot be understood are ignored. After teaching with pseudocode, we teach Python with [Pythonroom](https://pythonroom.com) and Java with the [APCS graphics](http://apcs.io) library. 

## Getting started

For Mac OSX, the easiest way to get started is to download the [Pseudocode application](https://github.com/MAC_APP_URL) and copy it into your Applications folder.

You can also download a [runnable JAR file](https://github.com/pseudocodeio/pseudocode/files/384411/Pseudocode.zip) that will work on any operating system with a Java runtime environment.

## Features

### Drawing shapes

You can draw multiple shapes including circles, squares, rectangles, ovals, and polygons. In addition, the many attributes of these shapes can be changed according to your preference.

```
draw a circle
create a square
place a circle
put a rectangle
```

![picture of a circle](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15526754/17146861/e7ca37da-5314-11e6-89df-c77c9d949f48.png)

You can position these shapes 

```
draw a circle at 100 100
draw a circle at the center
```

Their attributes are width, height, radius, size, diameter

```
draw a circle at 100 100 with a radius of 50
draw a square at 100 100 with a width of 50 and height of 50 
```

You can color shapes

```
draw a red circle
draw a green rectangle
```

You can draw polygons with predefined positions
```
draw a polygon from 0, 0 to 100, 100, 0, 50 to 0, 0
```

### Drawing images

You can draw images by giving a url or file path

```
draw image "URL"
draw image "FILE_PATH"
```

You can also use strings

```
set x to "FILE_PATH"
draw image x
```

Images have the same attributes as shapes

```
draw image "URL" at 100 100 with a size of 50
draw image "URL" at 100 100 with a width of 50 and height of 50
set x to "FILE_PATH"
draw x at 100 100
```

### Colors

You can use preset colors such as blue, green, or light green

```
draw a red circle
```

You can use RGB values

```
draw a rgb 255 0 0 circle
```

You can use Hex codes

```
draw a #fffffff circle
```

You can use random colors

```
draw a randomly colored circle
draw a random color circle
```

You can set the background to preset colors, RGB values, or hex codes

```
background to green
set background to rgb 255 255 255
set the background to #fffffff
```

### Mouse Functions
You can find the x and y positions of the mouse

```
set x to mouse x
set y to mouse y
```

With shapes, you can set their position to the mouse's position

```
draw a circle at the mouse
draw a circle at mouse x mouse y
```

**add mouse clicked**


### Variables

You can create variables and assign values to them

```
set x to 1
set y to x
set z to "hello"
```

### Lists

You can create lists

```
set x to 1, 2, 3
```

You can access a value in a list

```
print x of 1
```

You can change a value in a list

```
set x of 1 to 5 **changes all the values in the list**
```


### Random Numbers

You can set random numbers with undefined ranges

```
set w to random number
```

You can set random numbers with a set maximum and a minimum of zero

```
set x to random number to 100
```

You can set numbers with predefined ranges

```
set y to random number between 50 and 100
set z to random number from 100 to 150
```

### Forever loops

You can create infinite loops which can run code forever

```
forever draw a small circle at the mouse
repeatedly draw a big circle at 100 100
always draw a circle at 50 50
```

### Operators

You can add, subtract, multiply, or divide numbers

```
set w to 1 plus 2
set w to 1 + 2

set x to 4 minus 2
set x to 4 - 2

set y to 3 times 3
set y to 3 * 3

set z to 5 divided by 1
set z to 5 / 1
```

You can invert numbers (change their sign)

```
set x to invert 1
set x to reverse 2
```

You can increase numbers by predefined amounts

```
increment x by 1
increase y by 5
change z by 7
```

You can decrease numbers by predefined amounts

```
decrement x by 3
decrease y by 6
```

You can compare numbers
```
1 is 1  
1 == 1 (true)

2 is not 2 
2 != 2 (false)

1 greater than 2 
1 > 2 (false)

2 is less than 3 
2 < 3 (true)

4 greater than or equal to 4 
4 ≥ 4 (true)

6 less than or equal to 5 (false)
6 ≤ 5 (true)
```

You can use multiple operators at the same time

```
1 is 1 or 2 is not 2 (true)
2 < 4 and 4 != 4 (false)
```

You can find the absolute value of a number

```
set y to absolute value of -1
set f to absolute value of g
```

You can find the square root of a number

```
set z to square root of 4
set a to square root of b
```

You can find the distance between two points

```
set x to distance from 100,100 to 500,500
set z to distance from a, b to c, d
```

### If and if-else statements

You can use if statements with logic operators creating a condition

```
if x is y
	draw a circle at 100 100
```

You can use if-else statements so that code can be run even if your condition is not true

```
if x is less than y 
	draw a green square at 50 50 
else 
	draw a blue square at 100 100
	
if x > y 
	draw an orange circle at 50 50 
otherwise 
	draw a green circle at mouse
```

You can also compound multiple conditions with else if statements

```
if x is y 
	draw a square 
if x > y 
	draw a circle 
else 
	draw a green square
```

### Printing

You can print values

```
print x
```

You can print variables within text

```
set x to 5
print "The dog jumped over the quick brown fox by #x meters"

**Strings do not work**
set y to "pizza" 
print "The dog ate a lot of #y"
```

You can print a whole list

```
set x to 1, 5, 9
print "#x"
```

You can print an item in a list

```
set x to 1, 5, 7
print x of 1
print "The dog jumped over the quick brown fox by #x:1 meters"
```

### Waiting

You can pause your program for a certain amount of time

```
sleep 100
wait 100
delay 100
pause 100
```

### Functions **Not Currently Working**

You can create functions with "to" and set parameters with "with"

```
to functionName with x
	print x
```

You can set multiple parameters

```
to functionName with x and y
to functionName with v, w
```

You can run functions with "do"
```
do functionName with 1
do functionName with 3, 4
```

## Mesh

- When you join the mesh, asks for your name

- Should be completely transparent, no need to write/read explicitly from the mesh

```

```
