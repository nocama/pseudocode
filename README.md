# Pseudocode

Pseudocode is a live programming environment for pseudocode implemented by [Keshav Saharia](http://keshav.is). It started as a project for my advanced students and high school interns to develop a programming language, and has evolved into a useful teaching tool that we use at [TechLab Education](https://techlab.education). All of the code is open-source and well documented, so it should be quite easy to add new instructions, modify the parser, and extend the language.

The next step after pseudocode is a conventional program like Python or Java. I'm also the developer of [Pythonroom](https://pythonroom.com), a fun and easy way to teach Python in any classroom. 

## Overview of parsing and lexing

The steps of a parser

## Examples

- draw shapes
- infinite loops
- write if statements
- write if-else statements
- get mouse position and clicked

## Todo list

- [ ] Draw an image from the web
- [ ] Get all keywords into expression/Constant.java
- [ ] Formatting
- [ ] Ensure all files are commented
- [ ] Random numbers
- [ ] Random color
- [ ] Square root and absolute value (`square root of x`)
- [ ] Distance function (`distance from x, y to a, b`)
- [ ] Mesh with other
- [ ] Fix mouse clicked event
- [ ] Add polygons
- [ ] Arbitrary RGB colors
- [ ] Assign string to variable
- [ ] Parser tests - test individual parsing routines
- [ ] Commenting in the code (`// comment`)

## Future todo list

- [ ] Lists
- [ ] Functions

```
to draw a triangle at x, y,
	...
	
draw a triangle at x, y
```

```
to add one to x,
	set x to x + 1
	increment x
```

## Mesh

- When you join the mesh, asks for your name
- Once you're in the mesh, then other people can access your variables
- Should be completely transparent, no need to write/read explicitly from the mesh

```
draw a green circle at keshav's x, keshav's y
```
